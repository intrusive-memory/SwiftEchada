INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH, 30s, sits alone at a corner table, nursing a cold cup of coffee. She stares at her laptop screen, frustrated.

MARK, 40s, well-dressed and confident, enters and spots her immediately.

MARK
Sarah? Is that really you?

SARAH
(looking up, surprised)
Mark! What are you doing here?

MARK
I could ask you the same thing. It's been what... ten years?

Mark pulls out a chair and sits down without waiting for an invitation.

SARAH
(uncomfortable)
Give or take. I've been living in the city now. Working on a project.

MARK
Still writing that novel?

SARAH
(defensive)
It's a screenplay now. And yes, still working on it.

The BARISTA, 20s, approaches with a pot of coffee.

BARISTA
Refill?

SARAH
Please.

Mark watches as the barista pours, then leaves.

MARK
You know, I always believed in you. Even when things got... complicated.

SARAH
(coldly)
That's a generous way to put it.

MARK
Look, I didn't come here to rehash the past. I came because I heard you were working on something big. Something that could change everything.

Sarah's expression shifts from cold to curious.

SARAH
Who told you that?

MARK
Does it matter? I'm here now. And I want to help.

Sarah closes her laptop and leans back, studying Mark's face.

SARAH
Help? Or control?

MARK
(smiling)
Can't it be both?

FADE OUT.
