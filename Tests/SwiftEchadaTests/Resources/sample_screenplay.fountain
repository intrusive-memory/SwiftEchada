INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH, 30s, a determined casting director with sharp eyes, sits at a corner table reviewing headshots. Her laptop is open with dozens of actor profiles.

MARK, 40s, rugged and charismatic, enters. He's a veteran actor looking for his next big role.

MARK
Sarah! Long time no see.

SARAH
(looking up)
Mark! I didn't know you were auditioning today.

MARK
Wouldn't miss it for the world. What's the role?

SARAH
Detective Reynolds. Tough, world-weary, but with a heart of gold.

Mark sits down across from her.

MARK
Sounds like it was written for me.

SARAH
(smiling)
We'll see. There are fifteen other actors up for it.

The door opens. JESSICA, 20s, fresh-faced and nervous, enters carrying a portfolio.

JESSICA
(to Sarah)
Excuse me, are you Sarah Chen?

SARAH
That's me. You must be Jessica Martinez.

JESSICA
(nervous)
Yes! I'm here for the Emily role.

SARAH
Perfect timing. Have a seat.

Jessica sits, glancing at Mark with awe.

JESSICA
(to Mark)
You're Mark Davidson! I saw you in "City Limits."

MARK
(gracious)
Thanks. Good luck with your audition.

INT. CASTING STUDIO - LATER

A bare room with a camera setup. Sarah sits behind a table with ROBERT, 50s, the director, and AMY, 30s, the producer.

ROBERT
Next up is the lawyer character. We need someone who can handle rapid-fire dialogue.

AMY
I've got three strong candidates. First is Tom Chen.

TOM, 35, confident and well-dressed, enters.

TOM
Good afternoon, everyone.

ROBERT
Tom, let's start with scene seventeen.

Tom launches into the dialogue, delivering it perfectly.

INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mark and Jessica wait with several other ACTORS. An ASSISTANT calls out names.

ASSISTANT
Jessica Martinez?

Jessica takes a deep breath and stands.

JESSICA
(to herself)
You can do this.

She walks toward the studio door.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

Sarah and Robert sit at an outdoor table, reviewing notes.

SARAH
I think Jessica has real potential. Raw, but trainable.

ROBERT
What about Mark for Reynolds?

SARAH
He's perfect, but we need to confirm his availability.

ROBERT
And Tom?

SARAH
Too polished for the lawyer. I want someone scruffier.

A WAITRESS, 20s, brings their coffee.

WAITRESS
Here you go.

She leaves. Sarah makes a note.

SARAH
Actually, did you see her? She might work for the waitress role in scene forty-two.

ROBERT
(laughing)
You never stop casting, do you?

SARAH
It's what I do.

FADE OUT.

THE END
