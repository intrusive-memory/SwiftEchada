INT. OFFICE - DAY

SARAH (30s, F) sits behind a desk. JAMES (40s, M) enters.

SARAH
You're late.

JAMES
Traffic was terrible.

SARAH
That's what you said yesterday.

JAMES
Yesterday it was true too.

MARIA (20s, F) rushes in carrying coffee.

MARIA
Sorry! The line at the café was insane.

SARAH
At least someone has a good excuse.

JAMES
Hey!

MARIA
Here's your latte, Sarah. And James, black coffee.

JAMES
Thanks, Maria.

SARAH
Alright, let's get started. Where's the report?

JAMES
I sent it last night. Check your email.

SARAH
I see it. Good work, actually.

MARIA
Should I take notes?

SARAH
Please. Let's begin.
