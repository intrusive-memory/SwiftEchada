# SwiftEchada - Phased Development Methodology

## Development Approach

This project follows a **phased, gated development methodology** where each phase must meet specific completion criteria before proceeding to the next phase. This approach ensures:

- Stable foundation before adding complexity
- Early validation of core concepts
- Manageable scope for each phase
- Clear decision points for stakeholder review
- Reduced risk of rework

---

## Phase 0: Foundation & Setup ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks (Completed: Oct 10, 2025)
**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and validate core dependencies
**Status**: ✅ All deliverables complete, all gate criteria met

### Deliverables
- ✅ Project repository structure
- ✅ SwiftData environment setup
- ✅ SwiftGuion integration proof-of-concept
- ✅ Development environment configuration
- ✅ Testing framework setup (Swift Testing)
- ✅ Basic project documentation structure

### Tasks
1. ✅ Initialize Swift Package or Xcode project
2. ✅ Add SwiftGuion as dependency
3. ✅ Verify SwiftGuion can parse sample scripts
4. ✅ Configure SwiftData persistent store
5. ✅ Set up testing infrastructure
6. ✅ Create sample screenplay for testing
7. ✅ Document development setup process

### Gate Criteria ✓
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ SwiftGuion successfully parses test script
- ✅ SwiftData persistent store initializes
- ✅ At least one passing unit test (22 tests passing)
- ✅ README with setup instructions complete
- ✅ Development environment documented

**Decision Point**: ✅ APPROVED - SwiftGuion integration viable, SwiftData environment stable
**Completion Report**: See `Docs/PHASE0_COMPLETE.md`

---

## Phase 1: Core Data Models ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks (Completed: Oct 11, 2025)
**Goal**: Implement SwiftData models for Character, Actor, and basic relationships
**Status**: ✅ All deliverables complete, all gate criteria met

### Deliverables
- ✅ Character SwiftData model
- ✅ Actor SwiftData model
- ✅ Basic relationship structure
- ✅ Model validation tests
- ✅ CRUD operations for both models
- ✅ Sample data fixtures

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Character Model
- Define Character entity with SwiftData

- Add model validation logic
- Create unit tests for Actor model

**⚠️ CONFLICT IDENTIFIED**: Current implementation uses `photoPath: String?` and `additionalPhotos: [String]` which store file paths. This violates the binary data storage imperative (REQUIREMENTS.md Section 7.3). These should be changed to:
- `photoData: Data?` with `@Attribute(.externalStorage)`
- `additionalPhotosData: [Data]` with `@Attribute(.externalStorage)`

#### 1.3 Data Layer

- Build seed data script for development

### Gate Criteria ✓
- ✅ Character model persists and retrieves correctly
- ✅ Actor model persists and retrieves correctly

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **SwiftGuion Integration**: May not extract data as expected
   - *Mitigation*: Early POC in Phase 0, fallback to manual entry

2. **AI Cost Control**: AI API costs could spiral
   - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, cost monitoring, caching responses

3. **Performance**: Large casts may cause slowdowns
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing early, pagination, lazy loading

4. **Scope Creep**: Feature requests expanding scope
   - *Mitigation*: Strict phase gates, defer to Phase 2

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Binary Data Storage**: SwiftData `Data` storage could impact performance or database size
   - *Mitigation*: Image compression before storage, `@Attribute(.externalStorage)` for large data, lazy loading, size limits with warnings

2. **Data Migration**: Schema changes between phases (especially Phase 4 model changes)
   - *Mitigation*: Migration scripts to convert `photoPath: String?` to `photoData: Data?`, versioning strategy, backup before migration

3. **Cross-platform**: Differences between macOS and iOS
   - *Mitigation*: Start with single platform, expand later

---

## Agile Practices Within Phases

While this is a waterfall-style phased approach, each phase should use agile practices:

- **Daily/Regular Commits**: Commit working code frequently
- **Feature Branches**: Use git branches for each major feature
- **Code Review**: Review before merging to main
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests on every commit
- **Iterative Development**: Build features incrementally within phase
- **Retrospectives**: Review what worked/didn't at end of each phase

---

## Decision Authority

### Gate Approval Authority
- **Technical Gates** (builds, tests, performance): Lead Developer
- **Feature Completeness**: Product Owner / Stakeholder
- **Quality Gates**: QA Lead (or team consensus)
- **Release Decision**: Project Sponsor / Stakeholder

### Change Management
- **In-Phase Changes**: Developer discretion if scope unchanged
- **Phase Scope Changes**: Requires stakeholder approval
- **Phase 2 Deferrals**: Requires documentation in backlog
- **Emergency Changes**: Security/critical bugs bypass gates
